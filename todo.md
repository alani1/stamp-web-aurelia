## Active Todo List ##

* Work on application eventing
* Browser url parsing (standard library I can use?)
* Properly refactor odata-parser
* interaction between components.  entity-list needs edit, but title is only bindable from manage-list.  What if we want an action in the manage-list.  We should use event publish/subscribing
* The entity list table should be a component
* stamp list is long.  Can we shorten it?  Perhaps sort functions can be a separate object?
* move css to .js as static resources?
